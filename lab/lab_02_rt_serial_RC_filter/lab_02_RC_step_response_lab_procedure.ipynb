    "There are several challenges associated with running dynamic systems and control experiments using Arduino microcontrollers.  Two important challenges are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. getting data from the Arduino back to Python and\n",
    "2. running the experiments at hard, real-time intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run these experiments, Python must communicate with the Arduino using serial communication.  Serial communication does not work well if the Arduino is endlessly and constantly streaming data. So, an approach is needed that starts printing the data to the serial monitor when the test begins and then stops printing after a certain period of time.  When a test is over, the Arduino will stop printing data and go to a menu function where it will wait for the user to tell it to start the next test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it is best if dynamic systems and control experiments are performed at hard, real-time intervals which are best controlled using timer interrupts.  It is important that the Arduino perform its control actions at precise time intervals.  These actions generally include reading sensor values and sending actuator commands.  The time intervals will be controlled by a timer interrupt.  When the interrupt happens, it will set a flag variable to a value of 1 to tell the main `loop` function to perform the actions associated with the next time step in the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will recall that all Arduino scripts must have two required functions: `setup` and `loop`.  Once the `setup` function has been executed, the Arduino continually runs through the `loop` function.  While running a dynamic systems and control test, an Arduino is typically doing one of three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. waiting for the test to start\n",
    "2. waiting for the next timer interrupt\n",
    "3. performing the actions associated with one time step of a test\n",
    "\n",
    "So, each time through the `loop` function, the Arduino must decide if the timer interrupt has happened or if the test is over. If the test is not over, the Arduino continually checks whether or not the timer interrupt has happened.  If the timer interrupt has not yet happened, the Arduino essentially does nothing and goes back to the top of the `loop` function to check again if the timer interrupt has happened.  To accomplish this, most of the `loop` function is inside an `if` statement that only executes once the timer interrupt happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the timer interrupt happens, the Arduino reads all of the sensor values, sends out all actuator signals, and prints the data for that time step to the serial monitor.  These are the actions that are necessary for each time step of a dynamic systems and control test.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a certain number of time steps has occurred, where each timer\n",
    "interrupt corresponds to one time step, the Arduino stops sending data over serial and waits for the next test to start.\n"

This is very similar to what we did in lab 1 except that we need to find the step response at the same points in time where we have experimental data.  There are two options for doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve the step response symbolically with $p$ as a variable and then just have your `mymodel` function use that symbolic expression\n",

    "challenge: `control.step_response` expects the time vector to have\n",
    "perfect time steps that are exactly the same.  Essentially, it is expecting that your time vector was created using `np.arange`.  So, you need to find a way to create a fake, perfect time vector that is as close as possible to your real, experimental time vector.  Find the average time step `dt` from your experimental time vector and use it along with `np.arange` to create a fake time vector that has the same length as the experimental time vector.\n",

    "Note that in Python, functions always have read-only access to all of\n",
